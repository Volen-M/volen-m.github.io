# a summary about you
summary: | 
          
          I am a passionate **Software Developer/Analyst** who has been programming since the age of 15 as a hobby - I have since then pursued this passion academically obtaining a **Bachelor\'s in Computer Engineering** and then professionally with 4 years of full time experience.

          I take pride in writing **well-documented**, **readable** and **optimized** code.

          I further my programming and management skills weekly by developing Video Games as a hobby.


          **Learn more about my recent Time Management project which allows me to stay on track [here](/posts/personalprojects/time-management/).**
